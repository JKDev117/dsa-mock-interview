/*
Given a list of integers find the mode and the frequency of the mode. The mode in a list of numbers 
is the value that occurs the most often. If no number in the list is repeated, then there is no mode for the list.

- Input: `1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 3, 5, 6, 3, 3`
- Output: `Mode = 3, Frequency of mode = 4`
